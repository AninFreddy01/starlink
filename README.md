# starlink
Phase 3 of scalework, this is a Starlink case study. 

Solution Requirements
1.	Solutions Design Document (SSD): Provide a Solutions Design Document detailing your solution to this problem as an Azure AI Engineer Associate.
2.	Predictive Modeling: You are to construct a robust predictive model using Azure Machine Learning. Leveraging advanced algorithms and feature engineering techniques, the model should accurately forecast churn likelihood for individual customers and their predicted probabilities.
3.	Data: You are to provision any data storage (preferably an SQL Database) to within Azure's data ecosystem. Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure SQL Database offer scalable storage solutions, facilitating seamless data ingestion and preprocessing.
4.	Model Training and Evaluation: Through Azure Machine Learning Studio, you will have to train and fine-tune the predictive model using historical churn data. Employing techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, they will ensure the model's efficacy and generalization performance.
5.	Application Development: Use Streamlit to build a user friendly frontend that consumes ML API endpoints after your training on the data.  This application should provide real-time churn predictions and actionable insights, enabling proactive customer engagement strategies.
6.	Submission: Submit your project on or before the deadline.
